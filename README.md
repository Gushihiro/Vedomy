# vedomý
## A place to breathe, write, and reflect
## Hey there! We've created this space for anyone who needs a second to slow down, reflect, and collect themselves. Vedomý is Czech for "conscious", and we believe that a conscious life is a life lived in the present. A great way to live like this is by doing exactly what this place is designed to help you to do- breathe, write, and reflect. Click "Add Update" to journal about your current state, and it will be logged for future reference. Use the breathe module to help slow your internal pace. Check out a yoga pose, a sleep tip, or a new healthy recipe. Above all, enjoy your stay!
